# Load Cape

Hello...this is the Load Cape.

# Starter Software listed in the above files can be used on the BeagleBone Black and other am335x processor related boards from beagleboard.org.
`As things change in time, docs.beagleboard.org can be used to update ideas...`

    So, say this is your motor: positive & negative & GND
                                |           |           |
                                |           |           - GND
                                |           - Sink1
                                |
                                - VIN on the Load Cape while the positive
                                  lead from the battery goes into the VIN
                                  screw terminal on the Load Cape too.

P.S. Load Cape, this Cape can also be used for the BeagleV-Ahead which has a th1520 quad-core processor (c910). I
think this Load Cape can also be used with the BeagleBone-AI64 which is a dual-core A72 TDA4VM. More info in time...
