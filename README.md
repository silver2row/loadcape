    So, say this is your motor: positive & negative
                                |            |          
                                |            |
                                |            - Sink1
                                |
                                - VIN on the Load Cape while the positive
                                  lead from the battery goes into the VIN
                                  screw terminal on the Load Cape too.

                                - Battery GND goes to Load Cape GND
```

P.S. Load Cape, this Cape can also be used for the BeagleV-Ahead which has a th1520 quad-core processor (c910).

Enjoy
